Omaha solver is a landing page that is fully responsive to different devices.

Core technologies: 
Html, Sass(Scss syntax), Javascript.

Optional: 
1) Bootstrap 5 (I used only the grid to speed up the project. Only the bootstrap-grid.min.css file is included). 
2) AOS.js for animation.
3) Fontawesome Icon
